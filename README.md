The primary aim of this text is to analyze the behavior of holders of the museum card in 2013, focusing on the underlined dynamics and quantitative relationships.
The single subscription, as internet domain reported, has its origin in 1995 with a beginning valid ticket in 4 Civic museums. Since the first year of experimentation, the affiliated museum sites have been implemented, offering increasing opportunities and focusing on the "cherz-soi" tourist experience, through a continuous updating of the cultural landscape. The real growth in numerical terms, not without stationary periods, is attested starting from 2003 (going from 30,000 units up to over 100,000 in 2014), until representing up to 12% of the total number of visits. This market did not experience relevant slowdowns- due to the economic crisis- and it has been constantly modernized thanks to frequent qualitative and quantitative surveys.
Descriptive analysis, random and predictive modeling are the means by which this report will focus on card renewal.

Descriptive Analysis
------------------
<p align="justify">
The research has been carried out using 3 main datasets broadly showing personal data, information about the visits for each ID, the amounts paid and related discounts and furthermore the ID renewal.
In addition to these socio-demographic variables (already included in the reference datasets) to highlight further relationships, the following variables have been generated:

* _count_: number of total visits for each subscriber;
* _numero_ingressi_unici_: indicator of entrances to different museums for each visitor;
* _costi_entrate_: sum of the total cost that each visitor would have had to pay if he had not been a card holder; 
* _some geographical dummies_ to break down the territorial effect to live in the Center of Turin, in the first belt, in the second one and in the rest of the Northern Italy.

Moreover, thanks to the study of the consumersâ€™ joint visit through the association rules, it has been possible to consider in the descriptive analysis, **the number of visits that each individual has made at least with another person (binding no less than two shared entries), the average number of people with whom each member has shared an exhibition visit and finally the number of different people with whom each subscriber has logged in**. One of the first studies carried out, in terms of descriptive analysis, is related to the renewal by gender and age.

Taking into account the first two levels of the variable, there is a slight difference in terms of relative frequencies: in particular in this sample, the frequency of women who renew is around 70% while it is of 69% for men. The third column shows the units for which there is no answer linked to the gender variable and it allows us to reject the hypothesis of a link between NA and the renewal by sex variable, since the distribution seems to be similar to the other columns.
